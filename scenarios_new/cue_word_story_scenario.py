HELM Scenario: Cue-word-based Creative Story Generation

Paper: Evaluating Creative Short Story Generation in Humans and Large Language Models
       https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02316
       ICCC 2025

Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mismayil/creative_story_generation_dataset
License: Not specified (academic research)
GitHub: https://github.com/mismayil/creative-story-gen

Task: Creative Story Generation with Cue Words
Generate a creative short story (maximum 5 sentences) that includes three given cue words.

Cue word sets (from paper):
- Low semantic distance: "stamp, letter, send" and "petrol, diesel, pump"
- High semantic distance: "gloom, payment, exist" and "organ, empire, comply"

Prompt format (from repository src/prompts.py):
  System: You are an expert creative story writer. You will be given three words
  (e.g., car, wheel, drive) and then asked to write a creative short story that
  contains these three words. The idea is that instead of writing a standard story
  such as "I went for a drive in my car with my hands on the steering wheel.", you
  come up with a novel and unique story that uses the required words in unconventional
  ways or settings.

  User: Write a creative short story using a maximum of five sentences. The story must
  include the following three words: {cue_words}. However, the story should not be
  about {boring_theme}.

Dataset contains 479 pre-generated stories (236 human, 243 AI) with expert and non-expert
ratings on creativity, originality, surprise, and value. We use human-written stories
as references for evaluation.

Fields used: item_id (cue words), story (for human-authored stories as references)
Fields skipped: author (metadata), expert_*/non_expert_* (ratings for specific stories
in dataset, not applicable to new generations)

Evaluation: Open-ended generation (BLEU, ROUGE, F1 against human references)
Alternative: LLM-as-judge for creativity dimensions (see metric_notes.md)
