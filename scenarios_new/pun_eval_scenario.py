HELM Scenario: PunEval — Pun Understanding Evaluation

Paper: "A good pun is its own reword": Can Large Language Models Understand Puns?
       arXiv:2404.13599, EMNLP 2024, pages 11766–11782
Code:  https://github.com/Zhijun-Xu/PunEval

Tasks implemented (task parameter):
  generation  — Given a pun keyword and its two meanings, generate a pun sentence.
                Prompt: Method 1 (direct generation, no contextual words) from Notebook 5.
  explanation — Given a pun sentence, explain why it is a pun.
                Prompt: CoT recognition prompt from Notebook 2 (side="pun").
                Note: Paper derives explanations from the Reason field of the CoT
                recognition output; no standalone explanation prompt exists in the paper.

Task skipped:
  recognition — Binary pun/non-pun classification; not a creativity task.

Pun types (pun_type parameter):
  hom — Homographic: same spelling, different meanings (1,443 examples)
        e.g., "kid" = joke / young goat
  het — Heterographic: different spellings, similar sounds (1,146 examples)
        e.g., "clove" ≈ "clothes"
  all — Both combined (2,589 examples, default)

Data source: GitHub raw URL (no HuggingFace dataset)
  dataset/hom_dataset.json + dataset/het_dataset.json
  Merged from SemEval-2017 Task 7 + ExPun (Amazon Science)

Dataset note: 2,589 total entries, but 1,132 are SemEval-only entries lacking ExPun
  augmentation — they contain only human_text with no word-sense or explanation fields.
  Both tasks filter to the 1,457 fully annotated entries (pun_word present).

Fields used:
  generation:  pun_word, pun_sense, alter_word, alter_sense (prompt inputs)
               human_text (gold pun sentence; soft reference for BLEU/ROUGE)
  explanation: human_text (pun sentence input)
               human_explanation (gold explanation; reference for BLEU/ROUGE)

Fields skipped:
  pun_sense_key, alter_sense_key — internal WordNet sense IDs, not needed for prompts
  pun_word_ind    — SemEval entry ID, metadata only
  human_keywords  — used in Method 2 (contextually-constrained generation); not used here
  human_rating    — human quality rating of the pun; for calibration only
  (unannotated entries with only human_text) — 1,132 SemEval entries without ExPun fields

Evaluation:
  generation:  llm_judge (pun detection — is the output a valid pun?) + custom metrics
               Ambiguity, Distinctiveness, Surprise, Unusualness (see metric_notes.md)
  explanation: open_ended (BLEU/ROUGE vs human_explanation as reference)
