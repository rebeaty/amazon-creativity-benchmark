HELM Scenario: RPGBENCH — Game Creation Task

Paper: RPGBENCH: Evaluating Large Language Models as Role-Playing Game Engines
       arXiv:2502.00595 (2025)
Code:  https://github.com/boson-ai/rpgbench-public

Task: Given a Wikipedia biography of a character, generate a playable RPG game
scenario structured as a JSON object. The character becomes the main NPC.

This scenario implements the Game Creation task only.
Game Simulation (multi-turn interactive gameplay) is skipped — incompatible
with HELM's single-turn Instance architecture.

Prompt format (verbatim from rpgbench/static/game_creation_prompt.txt):
  Here is a character description:
  {name}: {description}

  Based on this character, create a detailed game scenario exactly following
  the JSON structure below:
  [game_json_schema]

  [guidelines from game_creation_prompt.txt]

Data: data/game_creation/characters.jsonl (100 Wikipedia character biographies)
      Loaded directly from GitHub raw URL (no HuggingFace dataset)
Fields used: id, name, description
Fields skipped: none

Evaluation: llm_judge (interestingness, 1-5 scale)
            Source: rpgbench/static/game_interestingness_prompt.txt
            See annotator_notes.md for judge configuration.
            Paper also uses structural validity check (JSON schema compliance),
            which can be computed programmatically without an LLM.

Note: Game Simulation task skipped. It requires multi-turn gameplay loops
      where the model alternately acts as game engine and player — fundamentally
      incompatible with HELM's single-turn Instance → References architecture.

# Guidelines verbatim from rpgbench/static/game_creation_prompt.txt
_GUIDELINES = """## Guidelines
- All numerical values should use consistent ranges (e.g., 0-100)
- Events should have clear cause-and-effect relationships
- Scene progression should depend on variable thresholds
- Include both mandatory and optional events
- Create meaningful connections between variables
- Balance difficulty and achievability
- Ensure all IDs follow consistent formatting (P### for checks, S### for scenes, V### for state variables, H### for hidden variables, E### for events)
- Include proper fail states and success conditions
- Make sure all scenes are specific locations
- Create logical progression paths through the game

Format the response as a single JSON object with all fields properly nested. Must ensure all arrays and objects are properly closed and formatted."""
