HELM Scenario: YesBut (Real Satirical Photographs Dataset)

Paper: ***YesBut***: A High-Quality Annotated Multimodal Dataset for evaluating
       Satire Comprehension capability of Vision-Language Models
       https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13592
       EMNLP 2024

Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/bansalaman18/yesbut
Website: https://yesbut-dataset.github.io/

Task: Satirical Image Understanding
Models are shown composite satirical images and asked to generate explanations
of why the image is funny/satirical.

Prompt format (from paper):
  [Image]
  Why is this image funny/satirical?

The dataset contains 1,084 satirical images with:
- left_image: Description of first half
- right_image: Description of second half
- overall_description: Ground truth explanation of the satire
- difficulty_in_understanding: EASY (954), MEDIUM (107), HARD (14)

Fields used: image, overall_description, difficulty_in_understanding
Fields skipped: left_image, right_image (textual descriptions, not needed for vision task),
                stage (all examples are 'stage2')

Evaluation: Open-ended generation (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.)
Reference answer: overall_description field

Note: Images are PIL objects from HuggingFace dataset, saved to temp files for MediaObject.
Pattern follows humordb.py implementation.
