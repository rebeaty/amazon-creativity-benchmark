HELM Scenario: SS-GEN (Social Story Generation)

Paper: SS-GEN: A Social Story Generation Framework with Large Language Models
       https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15695
Code/Data: https://github.com/MIMIFY/SS-GEN

Task: Generate Social Stories for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
      Social Stories are therapeutic narratives that help children understand social
      situations and develop coping strategies.

Prompt format (from paper Section 4):
  Develop a concise, clear, straightforward, positive and supportive Social Story
  titled "{title}" for children and teens with autism, 200-300 words, that promotes their social understanding and boosts their participation in daily activities, fostering independence and confidence.

Constraints (8 criteria from paper Appendix Figure 13):
  - Structural: Clear title, introduction, main body, conclusion
  - Voice/Tone: Positive, patient, literally accurate
  - Descriptiveness: 2:1 ratio of descriptive to coaching sentences
  - Perspective: First/third person only (never second person)
  - Content: Addresses WH-questions, celebrates achievements

Fields used: title, story_content (reference)
Fields available but not used in prompt: chapter, explanation (metadata), id
  - Note: chapter and explanation could be added to prompt for additional context,
    but paper evaluation used title-only prompts for consistency

Evaluation (from paper Section 4):
  - Traditional metrics: BLEU-4, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L
  - Human evaluation: Structural Clarity (1-5), Descriptive Orientation (Y/N),
    Situational Safety (Y/N)
  - GPT-4 evaluation: Coherence, Descriptiveness, Empathy, Grammaticality,
    Relevance (1-5 each)

Dataset: 5,085 stories across 57 thematic chapters
  - Train: 4,068 examples
  - Dev: 509 examples
  - Test: 508 examples
