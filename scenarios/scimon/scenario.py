HELM Scenario: SciMON

Paper: SciMON: Scientific Inspiration Machines Optimized for Novelty
       Wang et al., ACL 2024. arXiv:2305.14259
Code:  https://github.com/EagleW/Scientific-Inspiration-Machines-Optimized-for-Novelty

Task: Scientific inspiration sentence generation. Given background context from a
scientific paper and a source entity involved in a "used-for" relationship, generate
a sentence describing the novel scientific method, dataset, or approach involved.
Tests scientific creativity — the ability to propose scientifically grounded ideas
given a problem context.

Dataset: gold_subset/idea_sentence.json from GitHub (194 human-verified instances
  from 2022 ACL Anthology papers). All instances passed 5 human quality criteria:
    - Output is not trivially overlapping with the context
    - IE extraction is of sufficient quality (not generic, correct)
    - Context contains relevant information for the target relation
    - Relation is part of the main idea proposed by the paper
    - Sentence generation label = 1 (suitable for generation evaluation)

Each instance provides a background context (sentences from the paper's abstract),
a source entity (e.g., "paraphrase generation"), a relation type (always "used for"),
and a gold reference sentence (rel_sent) from the paper expressing the relation.

Prompt format (standard instruction format; paper uses fine-tuning, no explicit
zero-shot template specified):

  Scientific context: {context}

  The above context describes a problem in which "{entity}" is used for a scientific
  contribution. Write one sentence describing the novel scientific method, dataset,
  or approach involved.

Fields used:
  - context: background sentences from the paper abstract (input)
  - input:   entity + relation + type (e.g., "grammar is used for OtherScientificTerm"),
             used to convey relation direction and entity type in the prompt
  - rel_sent: gold reference sentence from the paper (CORRECT_TAG)

Fields skipped:
  - output:      short entity phrase (2-3 words); rel_sent is a richer generation target
  - neg_sample:  not present in gold_subset (only in full test set)
  - forward:     relation direction encoded in `input` field directly
  - cos_sim:     quality-filtering metadata (all examples passed all criteria)
  - annotation flags: all 1 (quality gate already applied)

Evaluation: open_ended — ROUGE-L, BERTScore against rel_sent gold reference
  Note: automatic metrics measure semantic similarity, not novelty per se.
  The paper's primary evaluation is human assessment of novelty, relevance, and
  technical depth. For novelty-sensitive scoring, see annotator_notes.md.
