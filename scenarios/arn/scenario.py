HELM Scenario: ARN (Analogical Reasoning on Narratives)

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00996 (TACL 2024)
Data: https://bit.ly/3t7qZ3S (Google Drive)

Task: Given a query narrative and two candidate narratives, select the one that
forms a better analogical mapping with the query based on high-level message
(system similarity) rather than surface features.

Dataset:
  - 1,095 triples (query, analog, distractor)
  - Four partitions based on analogy type (near/far) and distractor similarity (high/low)
  - Human accuracy: 96%

Prompt format (from Paper Appendix C.2 - GPT/Llama format):
  narratives can be mapped to each other in terms of the high-level message they
  strive to convey. These high-level messages can be related to traditions, common
  knowledge, or moral principles. We call this mapping analogical mapping. Which
  one of the two narratives (1, 2) can create a better analogical mapping with the
  query narrative? Answer in the template: {{narrative_x, because narrative_x and
  query_narrative are ...}}
  ———
  query_narrative: {query}
  ———
  narrative_1: {choice1}
  ———
  narrative_2: {choice2}
  ##########
  narrative

Subsets:
  "all" - Full benchmark (1,095 examples)
  "near_high" - Near analogies with high-similarity distractors (253 examples)
  "near_low" - Near analogies with low-similarity distractors (294 examples)
  "far_high" - Far analogies with high-similarity distractors (254 examples)
  "far_low" - Far analogies with low-similarity distractors (294 examples)

Fields used: query_narrative, first_choice, second_choice, correct_answer,
             analogy_level, distractor_similarity
Evaluation: exact_match (binary accuracy)
