HELM Scenario: Crowd Vote — Marketing Creativity Benchmark

Paper: "Creativity Benchmark: A benchmark for marketing creativity for large
        language models" (arXiv:2509.09702, CC-BY-4.0)
Platform: https://creativitybenchmark.ai/ (Springboards.ai)

Task: Given a brand name and one of three creative task types, generate a
concise, creative marketing response. The benchmark tests the model's ability
to produce surprising, brand-relevant creative advertising concepts — a form
of applied creative thinking.

Three prompt types (exact wording from paper):
  Insights:   "What is a surprising insight about people, culture, category,
               or product that [BRAND] could build a campaign around?
               Keep it under 10 words."
  Ideas:      "Propose a big, campaignable platform idea for [BRAND]. It
               should be based on a strategic or cultural truth and work
               across any channel. Keep it under 50 words."
  Wild Ideas: "What is your wildest unconventional campaign idea for [BRAND],
               something no traditional agency would dare present...?
               Keep it under 50 words."

System prompt (from paper):
  "You are a world-class brand strategist and creative thinker at a top global
   agency. Respond in plain text, single sentences, no preambles, with
   appropriate capitalization."

Dataset construction:
  The original study used 100 proprietary brand challenges (not publicly
  released). This scenario uses a curated set of 100 well-known brands
  (8–9 per category) covering all 12 categories from the paper. Brand
  selection follows the paper's category taxonomy; specific brands chosen
  to match the original study's diversity and global recognition criteria.
  100 brands × 3 task types = 300 instances total.

Prompt source: Verbatim from paper (arXiv:2509.09702, CC-BY-4.0).
Fields used:   brand (curated), category, task_type
Evaluation:    llm_judge (see annotator_notes.md)
  Original study used pairwise crowd voting (678 ad professionals, 11K
  comparisons). This scenario uses LLM-as-judge to assess originality,
  brand relevance, creative potential, and conciseness.

Parameters:
  task_type: "insights" | "ideas" | "wild_ideas" | "all" (default: "all")
