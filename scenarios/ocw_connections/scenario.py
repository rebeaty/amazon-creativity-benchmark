HELM Scenario: Only Connect Wall - Task 2 (Connections)

Paper: Large Language Models are Fixated by Red Herrings: Exploring Creative Problem
       Solving and Einstellung Effect using the Only Connect Wall Dataset
       https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11167
       NeurIPS 2023

Code: https://github.com/TaatiTeam/OCW
Dataset: TaatiTeam/OCW_main (HuggingFace)

Task: Given 4 already-solved groups of 4 words each, determine the thematic connection
      that links each group together. This is Task 2 from the paper - an auxiliary task
      that tests the ability to articulate connections after groups are identified.

Prompt format: From notebooks/run_openai.ipynb in the OCW repository
  System message explains the task
  User provides the 4 groups and prompts for connections
  Model outputs connection names

Format:
  Input: "Group 1: word1, word2, word3, word4. Connection:\n
          Group 2: word5, word6, word7, word8. Connection:\n..."
  Output: "Group 1: word1, word2, word3, word4. Connection: [name]\n
           Group 2: word5, word6, word7, word8. Connection: [name]\n..."

Fields used: wall_id, groups (gt_words and gt_connection)
Fields skipped: words (used in Task 1), season, episode, human_performance (metadata)

Evaluation: Standard open-ended metrics - exact match, ROUGE-1 F1, BERTScore F1
            The paper evaluates connection naming using these metrics.
