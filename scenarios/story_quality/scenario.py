HELM Scenario: Story Quality Rating (ScratchPlot)

Paper: "Plot Writing From Pre-Trained Language Models"
       (INLG 2022, arXiv:2206.03021)
Code: https://github.com/YipingNUS/scratchplot-story-generation
Dataset: Crowdsource annotations in repo crowdsource/ directory
         (Toloka platform, 3 annotators per story)

Story quality judgment task. Given a machine-generated story, rate its quality
on a 1-5 Likert scale. 100 stories from two generation systems (ScratchPlot
and plan-and-write, 50 content plans each), rated by 3 human annotators on
three dimensions.

Subsets:
  - interestingness (default): How interesting and engaging is the story?
  - coherence: How coherent and well-structured is the story?
  - naturalness: How natural and fluent is the story?

Ground truth: Rounded average of 3 annotator ratings per story.

Prompt source: Standard rating instruction. The paper publishes dimension-specific
  annotation guidelines in Appendix D (naturalness, interestingness, cohesiveness),
  but the full Toloka task template is not in the repo. This scenario uses a
  simplified single-prompt format inspired by the paper's 1-5 Likert scale.

Fields used: INPUT:story, INPUT:content_plan_id, INPUT:system, OUTPUT:category
Fields skipped: GOLDEN:category (empty), HINT:* (empty), ASSIGNMENT:* (worker metadata)
