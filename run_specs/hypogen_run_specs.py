# ── Rubrics ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

_RUBRIC_LLM_JUDGE_NOVELTY = """\
Evaluate the NOVELTY of the generated hypothesis flipping the conventional assumption.
Consider how creatively and originally the hypothesis challenges the given assumption.

Score 1: Hypothesis shows no novel thinking; follows the conventional assumption
Score 2: Minimal novelty; makes only slight modifications to the assumption
Score 3: Somewhat novel hypothesis with partial inversion of the assumption
Score 4: Notably novel hypothesis clearly inverting the assumption in an interesting way
Score 5: Highly novel hypothesis presenting a completely original and insightful inversion
